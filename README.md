Aim of project:
To increase interaction between devices of different screen sizes.

Project:
Create a web based app that would allow for users to send files to one another using a compass face. 
A user would upload a file in a certain direction and another would download the same file by pointing it in that same direction.
Allows for PTP interaction and interaction between different sized screens. 

Structure:
MySQL for database, PHP for interaction, JavaScript and HTML/CSS for front end. 

Current constraints: Used localserver with a connected wifi router due to internet problems in China. 
Future improvements: port over to webserver.
